This folder contains the entire dataset used to test the neural networks trained with fair datasets.

The dataset has been derived from the [Hogzilla dataset](http://ids-hogzilla.org/dataset/) by considering a subset of features that can be extracted in a SDN using OpenFlow calls.

The *Entire_Dataset* contains exactly 90% of normal and 10% botnet traffic samples.
